# Endless Scroll Photo Gallery with Loading Spinner

This project is a simple photo gallery that implements endless scrolling with a loading spinner. It fetches random photos from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and displays them in a grid format. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, more images are automatically loaded.

## Features

- **Endless Scrolling**: Automatically loads more photos as the user scrolls down.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a loading spinner while images are being fetched.
- **Responsive Layout**: Images are displayed in a responsive grid layout.
- **Random Photos from Unsplash**: Uses the Unsplash API to load a fresh batch of random images.
